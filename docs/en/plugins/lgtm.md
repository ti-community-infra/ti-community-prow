# ti-community-lgtm

## Design Background

In the TiDB community, we use a multi-stage code review approach to collaboration. A PR will typically be reviewed by multiple people before it meets the basic criteria for merging. For example, when the PR is reviewed by the first person, the PR is labeled with `status/LGT1`. Then when the PR is reviewed by the second person, the PR is labeled with `status/LGT2`. Each SIG sets the default number of LGTMs required, which is usually 2.

ti-community-lgtm is a plugin that automatically adds LGTM labels to PRs based on commands and permissions. It is deployed as a standalone service, with Prow Hook forwarding GitHub webhook events to the plugin for processing.

## Permission design

The plugin is responsible for the collaborative process of code review with the following permissions:

- `/lgtm` Or GitHub Approve
  - reviewers
    - maintainers
    - techLeaders
    - coLeaders
    - committers
    - reviewers

- `/lgtm cancel` Or GitHub Request Changes
  - reviewers
    - maintainers
    - techLeaders
    - coLeaders
    - committers
    - reviewers
  - **PR author**


## Design

The implementation of this plugin was not only about its support for the `/lgtm` comment command, but also about how it would integrate with GitHub's own review functionality as a collaborative code review tool. **Because we're building on GitHub's collaborative features, we need to strictly adapt and follow GitHub's own design logic and practices**.

Before implementing the plugin we need to define clearly the following three events:
- Issue Comment

- Single Review Comment

- GitHub review Feature（Include：**Comment/Approve/Request changes Three Features**）
![github-approve.png](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/29879298/100052399-d3c78480-2e58-11eb-874d-0e7a7bed149b.png)

After taking into account the original confusion of the TiDB community in using this feature, we have made the response to the lgtm event more restrictive, so that it will only be triggered if (**Commands are not case sensitive**):

- Use `/lgtm [cancel]` in Issue Comment
- Use `/lgtm [cancel]` in Single Review Comment
- Use GitHub's own Approve/Request Changes feature (**⚠️ Note: In order to follow the semantics of the GitHub review feature, we've ignored the Comment in it because GitHub's semantic definition of it is that there is no explicit Approve**)

**Special attention**:

- The command must start with `/` (**this is the basic specification for all commands**)
- Comments in the Review Feature will not take effect (please select Approve/Request Changes directly when using the Review function)

## Parameter Configuration 

| Parameter Name       | Type     | Description                                                                 |
| -------------------- | -------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| repos                | []string | Repositories                                                                |
| review_acts_as_lgtm  | bool     | Whether to treat GitHub Approve/Request Changes as a valid `/lgtm [cancel]` |
| pull_owners_endpoint | string   | PR owners RESTFUL API                                                       |

For example:

```yml
ti-community-lgtm:
  - repos:
      - ti-community-infra/test-live
      - ti-community-infra/tichi
      - ti-community-infra/ti-community-bot
      - ti-community-infra/ti-challenge-bot
      - tikv/pd
    review_acts_as_lgtm: true
    pull_owners_endpoint: https://prow.tidb.io/ti-community-owners # You can define different URL to get owners
```

## Q&A

### Why does `/lgtm` not work when I use the Review feature of GitHub to fill in a Comment?

Because we want to be compatible with GitHub's semantic definition of the feature itself: `Submit general feedback without explicit approval.`, using this feature will not be labeled with the LGTM label.

### Can I `/lgtm` my own PR?

No, even if you have reviewer access, it won't be credited as a valid code review, just like you can't approve your own PR on GitHub.

### Why does `/lgtm cancel` directly remove the results of my multiple reviews?

Because when a reviewer thinks that the code is faulty and needs to be re-reviewed, we think that the previous review is also faulty.

### Why do I have new commits LGTM related labels still kept?

This is because currently the TiDB community has a lot of code review phases, so if the bot cancels the LGTM as soon as a new commit is made, it can lead to a long PR review process and make PR merging difficult. So we loosened this part up to the reviewer and the author, and you can `/lgtm cancel` yourself when you feel you need to review again.
